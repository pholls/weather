# WeathrCheckr

This app is a Rails App that gets your 7-day weather forecast by zip code. It was built solo by [Pat Holland](https://github.com/pholls) in 3 hours as a coding challenge.

The app is deployed on Heroku here.

## Technologies

WeathrCheckr uses the [Aeris Weather API](https://www.aerisweather.com/support/docs/api/) to retrieve teh 7-day forecast.

### Future Goals

Given more time, there are a few things I would have liked to improve upon.

* Styling
    * displaying the daily forecasts in a nice grid
    * arranging the boxes
* Icons
    * display a relevant picture of the weather forecast
* Not hard-coding the API key
    * this was done to save time,
